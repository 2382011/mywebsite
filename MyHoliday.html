            Hello, my name is <b>Elsa Yunita Sihotang</b>. I want to tell you about an event during my holiday.</i>
            It's about <i>My Job</i>. I come from Riau. I have 3 brothers.
            I want to tell you about my vacation when I was on holiday from college for 3 months.</i>
        </i>Well, at first I didn't intend and didn't think about returning to my hometown because of my family's finances,
            and I didn't have the heart.<i>
        </i>but my mother told me to go home and help with work at home and in the market.
        <p>
            Because I couldn't bear to see my mother selling alone without anyone helping, and I went back to my village.</i>
            Actually, my father and sister can help but only on Sundays because on Thursdays my father works and my brother goes to school. 
        </i> And when one month ended I intended to work, I said to my mother "Mom, I want to work".
        </i>Because my mother has a subscription to a food stall, namely pecal catfish. Finally I worked. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I started working in mid-June and time passed.at the beginning of August I finished work. </i>
            So every day I help my mother with housework,and on Thursday and Sunday morning I help my mother at the market.<i>
            </i>And in the afternoon I go to work at the food stall, from 5 pm to 11 pm. 
            and I returned to Bandung on August 14.
        </p>
